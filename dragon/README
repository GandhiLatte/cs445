Implement type checking


TINO HINTS:
Create functions to pass trees and make sure the types are correct for each side of the trees
Semantic Checker


Put the checks in the semantic Checker

Or

Make dedicated functions in a dedicated files (semantic.c)
- functions that check trees
- chase down the tree
- needs to know about the symbol table pointers


below statement trees are syntax trees

visbale line between declaration and usage

anything ebfore the begin end is used purely for declaration

semantic checking and code generation

HINTS
------------
Insert into mknode the return type
    - In nodes make sure there is a return type, if 0 then no return type (can we double this as soemthing)
    -
